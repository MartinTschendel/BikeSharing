# FordGoBike
Visual exploration of data from the Ford GoBike sharing system, covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. This project is conducted within a Udacity Nanodegree for Data Analytics. The data is taken from this [web page](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data).

2019-04-11: Some interesting univariate explorations have been made (number of rides between different hours, weekdays and months)

2019-04-12: Some interesting bivariate explorations have been made

2019-04-13: Added a clustered bar chart

2019-04-14: Added a scatter plot with the geographic position of the rental stations

2019-04-15 & 16: Added information on annual ride counts to scatter plot 

2019-04-17: Polished the structure of the notebook

2019-04-20: included respective explanatory analysis documents (project_explanation_slides.ipynb & project_explanation_slides.slides.html)

2019-04-22: the plan is to use data from other cities such as New York and compare it to the data from the San Francisco Bay Area. Additionally, data such such as age could be explored 

2019-04-23: These web pages hopefully provide datasets for the purpose mentioned above:
